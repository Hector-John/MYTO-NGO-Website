    <h1>What MYTO Does (How we work)</h1>
    <p>
      Influenced by the new development paradigm, which puts people before things, MYTO follows a maximum participatory
      team approach in every sphere of its work. The Community knowledge and culture is valued and respected, and there
      is confidence that the community are capable of self-reliant. On a practical level, the fundamental thrust of this
      approach is decentralization and empowerment.

      <br> <br>For a community to be able to work for its own development and reduce its dependency there is a need for
      full involvement at all stages of the development cycle. The participation of communities in identification,
      planning, management, implementation and evaluation of projects is a key factor in MYTO work. Internally a
      participatory approach is adopted in managing the affairs of MYTO. This creates a sense of ownership for the
      project and programmes MYTO undertake at the community level.

      <br> <br>Externally, MYTO role as a “change agent” helps to develop community management structures that are
      capable of managing their own development. This increases the ability of the community to demand accountability in
      all their affairs, from leaders and officials. It reinforces the community's belief in the value of their own
      development choices and efforts. These community management structures are not parallel structures, but are built
      upon community institutions, promoting equitable representation and participation.


      <br> <br> Human resource development is an essential part of our development work. This means ensuring that the
      community is trained and skilled, as well as organized, to maximize the potential of the community to take hold of
      its own development.

      <br> <br> MYTO strongly believes in maximizing its impact by transferring field experiences into knowledge to
      influence the development policies and practices of NGOs, donors and government agencies. This is important for
      working towards the long-term goal of eradicating poverty.
